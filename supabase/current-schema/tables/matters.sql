/* 
Features we want to support:

1. Each matter will have:
A. An email address associated with it so attorneys can send email to 19fl002753@associateattorney.ai and that email will be associated with the matter.
B. Goals -- for the structure see goals.sql
C. Tasks -- for the structure see tasks.sql
D. Events -- for the structure see events.sql
E. Files -- stored inside gitea git repository.

2. A matter can be archived but it cannot be deleted.

3. A matter has a name and description which can be edited by anyone with edit rights.
